# CitygenAR - City Generator
AR City Generator is an augmented reality application built in Unity that generates a 3D city using procedural content creation for roads and houses.

## Description
The app allows the user to experience an immersive environment with a 3D city that can be explored from different angles. The city is generated procedurally, so every time the user opens the app, they will experience a different layout.

At the current development cycle, the app generates roads and houses. The roads are created using procedural algorithms that ensure proper connectivity and smooth curves. The houses are generated randomly and have various styles, sizes, and colors.

In future updates, we plan to add terrain and cultures to the city generator. The terrain will be generated procedurally, and different types of cultures will be integrated into the city's layout, including architecture, landscapes, and lifestyles.
